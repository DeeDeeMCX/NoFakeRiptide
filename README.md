# NoFakeRiptide
Fixes riptide tridents in EssentialsX

This plugin fixes an old bug caused by the EssentialsX /pweather command.

EssentialsX lets players set their own personal weather using /pweather. However, if someone sets their weather to rain, they could sometimes use their riptide tridents even when the server weather was clear â€“ since the rain only appeared client-side. But not anymore!
